The Google Colab code is designed to search for anime based on a combined matrix of anime file data and user ratings. The data is processed using KNN, which identifies animes with similar features. By entering the name of an anime, the code analyzes the data and provides a list of animes with similar characteristics.
For instance, the code can provide information on the anime's genre, rating, and synopsis, as well as user reviews, and recommendations based on the anime's popularity.

Usage
The recommendation system uses KNN to find anime titles that are similar to each other based on various parameters such as genre, ratings, and other features.
Future Improvements
Future improvements to this recommendation system could include implementing collaborative filtering to suggest titles to users based on the viewing histories of other users with similar preferences. Additionally, the accuracy of the system could be improved by introducing machine learning algorithms that support learning through epochs
